### Project by Kaleigh White and [Rowen Jennings](https://rowenjennings.netlify.app/)

For our final project for our Data Analytics class, we analyzed preliminary data from the CDC on drug overdose deaths in the US from March 2020 - March 2021. In this project, we compared three different states of similar populations and created plots of the data to show how the total changed each month. We created a number of different plots comparing different data points to try and determine a general causality for some counties having higher rates than others (such as time of year, location, etc). We had to work around gaps and biases in the data, but we ultimately came to a solid conclusion. You can check out the project and our full report [here](https://github.com/Allegheny-Computer-Science-301-F2021/finalproject-rokal-team).
