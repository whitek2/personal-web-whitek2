#### Project by Kaleigh White

For my senior comprehensive project ("comp"), I studied the marketing of "Hamilton: An American Musical" as it related to the history of so-called "American" musicals on Broadway as well as to the modern-day attention economy. To do this, I utilized data from Google Trends for relative searches during specific periods of the show's run. Through this, I was able to show how their various marketing strategies (including staggering the release of the digital and physical albums, the "Ham4Ham" performances that took place before the daily lottery, and a few other key points) contributed to increased search activity for various terms related to "Hamilton."
