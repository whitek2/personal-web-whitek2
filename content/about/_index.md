My name is Kaleigh White. I am 22 years old and I am from Linesville, Pennsylvania. I graduated high school in the top 20% of my class in 2018, after which I matriculated at Allegheny College. My senior year of high school, I took classes at Allegheny in the morning, putting me a little bit ahead of my peers in terms of credits.
When I came to Allegheny, I was bound and determined that I was going to study theatre and go into theatre performance professionally. After getting here, I applied for a work study position in the costume shop, working under the shop supervisor and resident costume designer. I got the job, and I haven't looked back. While I do love performing, I also came to realize that I love *creating* theatre, too. As a costume shop technician, I've developed skills in cutting, stitching, and draping, as well as pattern drafting and alterations among other things. I am very grateful to have gotten this position, and I don't know what I'd be doing without it.
I had initially intended to minor in economics. With this, I figured I could get a job in business or marketing, and maybe graphic design and advertising, too. While taking a communications class to fill out my schedule, I heard of the college's new major in integrative informatics. I talked with some of the department faculty, and it sounded exactly like what I wanted. It had everything that I had wanted from the economics minor, and everything that the economics minor did not provide. The informatics major combines my love of marketing, data analytics, and graphic design in a way that I hadn't known was possible. With the informatics major, I hope to go into theatre marketing and management, and I know I would be happy in such a position.
